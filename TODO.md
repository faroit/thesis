# Tasks for Highly Overlapped sources

Source Separation Literature and basic techniques
Source Counting literature

Aber wie soll das funktionieren für counting. Es gibt keine basic techniques die funktionieren. Daher passt da snicht so gut rein.

# Aspects of Concurrency

* Analysis

What is a good metric of concurrency? Timbre/Dense doesn't really work, because it is hard to quantify.
Better is just counting, but count what?

number concurrent sources, number of different sources, maximum number of sources
Detection vs Subitizing vs

ICA war entry-study... daher so einfache Frage

* Separation

Count by detection is not useful

SEPARATION OF HARMONIC STRUCTURES BASED ON TIED GAUSSIAN MIXTURE
MODEL AND INFORMATION CRITERION FOR CONCURRENT SOUNDS

Auditory scene analysis based on time-frequency integration of shared FM and AM

 # counting

 discuss that music signals lack a proper source definition. Therefore counting on music signals in ill defined. However, it may work on some specific cases. We tried on ... but it didn't work.
