\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we presented a method to exploit common modulation textures for source separation. A transformation based on a complex tensor representation computed from patches of the STFT has been introduced. We then showed how these patches are factorized by the proposed \emph{Common Fate Model}, which is derived from the idea of humans perceiving common modulation over time as one source. Our results on unisonous musical instruments indicate that this method can perform well for this scenario. The CFM model could also be successfully used in other scenarios, such as speech separation.
