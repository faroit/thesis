\chapter{Separation by Unknown Modulation}
\label{cha:unknown}

In the previous chapter, methods were proposed to separate highly overlapped signals, informed by an estimate of pitch variation of the source to be separated.
Even though, I showed that pitch variation can be estimated from the mixture, often, it is not easy to obtain in practice.
In contrast, in this chapter, I will introduce separation methods which do not incorporate prior knowledge about the modulation. 
In fact, some of the methods operate blindly, meaning they do not require any further information about the sources except for the number of sources to be separated.
\par
In blind source separation research, many contributions in the were based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)~\cite{lee99, lee01}.
NMF quickly became one of the main scientific frameworks in the field of audio source separation with a large number of contributions.
The popularity of NMF algorithms can be explained by the intuitive way in which they work on (non-negative) time-frequency representations of the mixture signal.
Assuming the magnitude STFT \(\mX \in \sR_{+}^{F \times T}\), NMF incorporates non-negative constraints to perform the separation into the sum of \(K\) components which are each factored into two matrices (usually referred to as \emph{basis} \(\mW \in \sR_{+}^ { F \times K }\) and \emph{activations} \(\mH \in \sR_{+}^ { T \times K }\)). 

\begin{equation}
   \mathbf{X} \approx \mW \mH^{T} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{K} \vw_{j} \circ \vh_{j}
   \label{eq:vanilla_nmf}
\end{equation}

As it can also be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:nmf}, the factorization can also be written as the outer product between two rank-1 matrices (using the \(\circ\)-operator).

\begin{figure}[t]

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Chapters/06_Separation_Unknown/figures/nmf.pdf}
  \caption{Visualization of the product of two rank-1 vectors as being used in non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).}
  \label{fig:nmf}
\end{figure}


The NMF provides a rank reduction which allows to decompose mixtures into (\(K\)) source components.
At the same time, the factorization inherently follow specifics of music, observable in time-frequency representations: the fact that harmonic sources can be described using a pitch/tone (represented in \(\mW\)) and its duration (represented in \(\mH\)).
It is this property that also allowed to use NMF for the purpose of transcriptions~\cite{smaragdis03}.
\par
To obtain the factorization, one would need to solve an optimization problem resulting in a non-unique solution.
Each factorization is calculated by minimizing and the error between \(\mX\) and \(\mW \mH^{T}\) with respect to some cost function

\begin{equation}
  \min_{\mW,\mH} \mathrm{D}(\mX | \mW \mH) \text { subject to } \mW \geq 0 , \mathbf \mH \geq 0.
\end{equation}

In most source separation methods the beta-divergence cost function

\begin{equation}
  D_{\beta} (x | y) = \frac { 1 } { \beta ( \beta - 1 ) } \left( x ^ { \beta } + ( \beta - 1 ) y ^ { \beta } - \beta x y ^ { \beta - 1 } \right) \quad \beta \in \mathbb { R } \backslash \{ 0, 1 \}
\end{equation}

is being used~\cite{fitzgerald08a}. 
The special cases of \(\beta = 0\) and \(\beta = 1\) \(D\) correspond to the Itakura-Saito (IS) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the euclidean distance equals to (\(\beta = 2\)).
To efficiently compute the optimization, an algorithm was proposed~\cite{lee01} which makes use of simple to use multiplicative update rules, derived from the cost function.
For further details about this aspect, the reader is again referred to~\cite{cichoki09}.
\par
After factorizing into its \(K\) components, one can obtain \(K\) magnitude spectra.
However, \(K\) is usually selected to be larger or equal to the total number of sources.
When it is larger than the number of sources, components can be clustered into the number of desired sources (usually \(\leq K\)).
Often this can be achieved by some similarity metric that allows to calculate pairwise distances between components with the desired sources and applying \textit{k}-means clustering algorithm~\cite{spiertz09}.
A separation example is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:nmf_separation}. 
Here the number of components \(K\) is six per sources, resulting in total number of \(K=12\). 
Each component is clustered into one of two sources to generate two estimates.

  \caption{NMF}
  \label{fig:nmf_separation}
\end{figure}

It is this step that transforms the NMF as an unsupervised algorithm into a supervised algorithm.
As for other separation methods performed in the time-frequency domain, separation is achieved using Wiener filters to extract the sources from the mixture~\cite{liutkus15c}.
\par
% from zafar...
The first work on NMF based audio separation was proposed by Vembu and Baumann in~\cite{vembu05}. 
They used NMF to separate vocals from mixtures and first discriminated between vocal and non-vocal sections in a mixture by using different combinations of features, such as MFCCs \cite{david80}. 
The components are grouped into vocal and non-vocal by using a vocal/non-vocal classifier with MFCC coefficients.
% end zafar...
Since then a large variety of NMF ``flavors'' were introduced to improve certain aspects of the NMF in the application of music. 
Many of them are listed in~\cite{vincent}.
In Chapter~16 of that book the authors describe one of the main problems with NMF which is that ``standard NMF is shown to be efficient when the notes of the analyzed music signal are nearly stationary''.
As I described in Chapter~\ref{cha:highly-overlapped-signals}, this is especially important for pitches that incorporate vibrato.
Here, NMF based processing suffers from its simplified model and also its magnitude STFT representation which makes it harder to model these time-varying sources.
\par
To underpin this issue, I depict this problem in Figure~\ref{fig:am_tensor_nmf} where I show the factorization of a simple amplitude modulated input signal. 
The signal consists of two sinusoids which are linearly mixed. 
Both share the same carrier frequency but have different amplitude modulation rates. 
When we apply a factorization with $K=2$, one can see that NMF is unable to separate the two signals sufficiently and instead activates both sources in an alternating pattern.

One way towards better separation is to increase the number of components per source, however this introduces difficulties in the clustering.
Another method is based proposed by in~\cite{smaragdis04, fitzgerald05s, jaiswal13, rodriguezserrano16} which use convolutions to model shifts in components.
This lead to factorizations that are able to also model vibrato events.
However as stated in~\cite{hennequin11}, it does ``not  permit  any variation  between  different  occurrences  of  the  same  event (atom), its duration and spectral content evolution being fixed''. 
Instead, Hennequin proposes a frequency-dependent activation matrices by using a source/filter-based model.
The model is based on an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) time varying model that allows single spectral components to be modeled along with their spectral variations. 
The model, as reported by the authors, however, does only allow for small frequency variations and fitting the ARMA model is a time-consuming process.

\section{Exploiting Amplitude Modulation using Tensor Factorizations}
\label{sub:am}

\marginpar{Parts of this subsection is also based on the work~\cite{stoeter14}.}

Another way to improve separation of modulated sources is the use of higher-dimensional representations.
To utilize e.g. a third dimension, a variety of models exist to factorize the tensor into three factors and apply a similar rank reduction as in the NMF case.
Tensors factorizations allow to incorporate more complex models and are therefore useful for applications with more than two dimensions.
In audio separation, tensor factorization were originally proposed to address multichannel separation as in~\cite{fitzgerald08, fevotte10, ozerov11}. 
Barker and Virtanen~\cite{barker13} were the first to propose a modulation tensor representation for single channel source separation. 
\par
In the following section I will introduce the work of Barker and how it can be applied to the unison source separation problem.
Since vibrato does not only cause frequency modulation (FM) but also amplitude modulation (AM), so-called modulation spectra can be used to identify the modulation pattern. 
The modulation spectrogram is a time-frequency-frequency representation of a time domain input signal.
A complete signal representation is obtained by a modulation tensor which holds the modulation spectrograms for each time frame.
The \emph{modulation spectrogram} has already gathered much attention in speech recognition~\cite{greenberg97, kingsbury98} and classification~\cite{kinnunen08, markaki09} as introduced in Chapter~\ref{cha:fundamentals}.
\par
In practice, the modulation tensor \(\mathbf{V}_{f, b, t}\) can be computed from a the modulus of a time frequency matrix \(| \mathbf{X}_{f, t} |\) by computing \(f\) time frequency transforms over frequency band of \(\mathbf{X}\).
The intuition here is that one could observe that different amplitude modulation frequencies on certain frequency bands could be a distinct property of some instruments.
As proposed by~\cite{barker13}, the non-negative tensor factorization approximates a modulation tensor \(\mV\) by a product of three matrices containing the frequency/basis \(\mW\), time/activation \(\mH\) signals, and the modulation gain for each component \(\mM\).
The product of this n-way rank-1 vector factorization is often referred to as \emph{PARAFAC}~\footnote{Also known as ``Polyadic form of a tensor'', PARAFAC (parallel factors), CANDECOMP or CAND (canonical decomposition) or CP (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC)~\cite{kolda09}}.

In the vein of the NMF factorization mentioned in Equation~\ref{eq:vanilla_nmf}, a 3-way NTF can simply be extended to:

\begin{equation}
   \mathbf{V} \approx \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} \mathbf{w}_{k}(f) \circ \mathbf{m}_{k}(b) \circ \mathbf{h}_{k}(t).
\end{equation}

This notation is very commonly used in many tensor factorization applications~\cite{kolda09}.
However, I found that it is easier follow when the individual tensor elements are used, which is also the recommended notation proposed in~\cite{kiers00}, for  $f = 1 , \ldots , F , b = 1 , \ldots , B , t = 1 , \ldots , T$:

\begin{equation}
  v_{fbt} \approx \sum_{k = 1}^{K} w_{fk} m_{bk} h_{tk}.
\end{equation}

A visualization of the 3-way PARAFAC product is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:cpd}.

\par
Compared to~\cite{barker13} we choose to generate the modulation tensor in way that is simpler and easier to invert. 
Barker and Virtanen used a Gammatone filter bank and rectification to model the characteristics of the human auditory system. 
We, instead, used a two-stage DFT filter bank where the modulation domain is based on magnitude STFT. Although this can give perceptually less optimal results, each step can be directly inverted by using the complex representation.
Barker already showed that the NTF based approach gives good results on speech signals compared to the standard NMF. 
Motivated by these results, I wondered if the modulation NTF can be used to separate two instrument mixtures by their amplitude modulation characteristics, as it is the case in the unison scenario.
\par
Thus, let us return to the example from Figure~\ref{fig:am_tensor_nmf} of two harmonic signals having the same fundamental frequency of 440~\si{\hertz} and one signal has a stationary amplitude modulation of 4~\si{\hertz} whereas the another one of 10~\si{\hertz}. 
These differences now turn out to be latent in a non-negative modulation tensor representation.
In contrast to NMF, Figure~\ref{fig:am_ntf} shows valid factorizations of unison signal using NTF.
It gives a smoother activation matrix and is able to generate the output with the separated amplitude modulations on each sinusoid. The modulation frequency gain matrix shows the two modulation frequency templates and the DC-component.

\par
A comparison of the modulation tensor approach compared to the pitch variation informed method on the unison separation scenario has been carried out in our work published in~\cite{stoeter14}.
Results indicated that modulation tensor factorization generally performs worse than informed methods.
The reason is that, that it does only consider amplitude modulation even though frequency modulations are the actual source of modulation.
In the next section we investigated how the complex modulation patterns that consist of both, frequency and amplitude modulation patterns caused by the instrument vibratos, can improve the separation quality.

\section{The Common Fate Model for the Separation of Unison Mixtures}

\marginpar{This section is based on the work that has been published in 2016~\cite{stoeter16}. The is based on the original idea from Antoine Liutkus (INRIA, France) and was published with the support of Roland Badeau (ParisTech, France) and Paul Magron (ParisTech, France)}

In this work a novel tensor signal representation is introduced which additionally exploits similarities in the frequency direction.
We can therefore make use of dependencies between modulations of neighboring bins.
This is similar to the proposed High-Resolution Nonnegative Matrix Factorization model that accounts for dependencies in the time-frequency plane (HR-NMF~\cite{badeau11}).
In short, HR-NMF models each complex entry of a time-frequency transform of an audio signal as a linear combination of its neighbors, enabling the modeling of damped sinusoids, along with an independent innovation.
This model was generalized to multichannel mixtures in~\cite{badeau13a,badeau14} and was shown to provide considerably better oracle performance for source separation than alternative models in~\cite{magron15a}.
Indeed, even though some variational approximations were introduced in~\cite{badeau13} to strongly reduce their complexity, those algorithms are often demanding for practical applications.
In this work, we proposed to relax some assumptions of HR-NMF in the interest of simplifying the estimation procedure.
The core idea is to divide the complex spectrogram into modulation patches in order to group common modulation in time and frequency direction.
We call this the \emph{Common Fate Model} (CFM), borrowing from the Gestalt theory, which describes how human perception merges objects that move together over time:

\begin{quote}
``The Gestalt psychologists discovered that when different parts of the perceptual field were changing in the same way at the same time, they tended to be grouped together and seen to be changing as a group because of their common fate.''~\cite{bregman94}  
\end{quote}

Bregman introduced the Common Fate theory for auditory scene analysis as the ability to group sound objects based on their common motion over time, as occurs with frequency modulations of harmonic partials.
As outlined by Bregman, the human ability to detect and group sound sources by small differences in FM and AM is outstanding.
Also, it turns out, as mentioned in Section~\ref{exploiting-slow-modulations}, that humans are especially sensitive to modulation frequencies around 5~Hz, which is the typical vibrato frequency that many musicians produce naturally.

\subsection{The Common Fate Transform}
\label{sub:CFT}

Let $\tilde{x}$ denote a single channel audio signal.
Its Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) is computed by splitting it into overlapping frames, and then taking the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of each one.
Since the waveform~$\tilde{x}$ is real, the Fourier transform of
each frame is Hermitian. In the following, we assume that the redundant
information has been discarded to yield the STFT.
The resulting information is gathered into an $N_{\omega}\times N_{\tau}$
matrix written~$\mX$, where~$N_{\omega}$ is the number of frequency
bands and $N_{\tau}$ the total number of frames.
In this study, we will consider the properties of another object, built from $\mX$, which we call the Common Fate Transform (CFT).
\par
It is constructed as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:CFT}.
We split the STFT~$\mX$ into overlapping rectangular $N_{a}\times N_{b}$ patches, regularly spaced over both time and frequency.
For reference later in this thesis, we will call this representation the \emph{Grid STFT} (GFT).
Then, the 2D-DFT of each patch is computed\footnote{Note that since each patch is complex, its 2D-DFT is not Hermitian, thus all its entries are kept.}.
This yields an $N_{a}\times N_{b}\times N_{f}\times N_{t}$ tensor where~$N_{f}$ and~$N_{t}$ are the vertical and horizontal positions for the patches, respectively.
\par
As can be seen, the CFT is basically a further short-term 2D-DFT taken over the standard STFT~$\mX$.
One of the main differences compared to modulation spectrograms is that the CFT is computed using the complex STFT~$\mX$, and not a magnitude representation such as $\left|\mX\right|$.
As we will show, this simple difference has many interesting consequences, notably that the CFT is invertible: the original waveform~$\tilde{x}$ can be exactly recovered by cascading two classical overlap-add procedures.
Another difference is that the patches span several frequency bins, \emph{i.e.} we may have~$N_{a}>1$.
This contrasts with the conventional modulation spectrogram, that is defined using one frequency band only.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Chapters/06_Separation_Unknown/figures/CFT}
\caption{Common Fate Transform. For convenience, the splitting of the STFT
into patches has been depicted without overlap, but overlapping patches are used in practice\label{fig:CFT}.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{A Probabilistic Model for the CFT}

\label{ssub:separation}

When processing an audio signal~$\tilde{x}$ for source separation,
it is very common to assume that all time-frequency (TF) bins
of its STFT are independent~\cite{fevotte09, duong10, ozerov12, liutkus11t}.
This is often the consequence of two different assumptions.
The first one is to consider that all frames are independent, thus
leading to the independence of all entries of the STFT that do not belong to the
same column. The second one is related to the notion of stationarity:
roughly speaking, the Fourier transform is known to decompose stationary
signals into independent components, whether these signals be Gaussian
(see, e.g.~\cite{liutkus11t}) or, more generally, harmonisable.
As a consequence, when the signals are assumed to be \emph{locally stationary},
it is theoretically sound to assume that all the entries of
their STFT are independent.

Still, both assumptions can only be considered as approximations.
First, adjacent frames are obviously not independent, notably because
of the overlap between them. Second, the stationarity assumption is
only approximate in practice, especially when percussive elements are
found in the audio, leading to strong dependencies among the different
frequency bins. Let $\{ \mX_{ft}\} _{f,t}$
denote all the $N_{a}\times N_{b}$ patches taken on the STFT to compute
the CFT, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:CFT}. The probabilistic
model we choose is the combination of \emph{three} different assumptions
made on the distribution of these patches\footnote{A forth assumption made in~\cite{stoeter16} refers to the joint distribution of all entries of each patch which are $\alpha$-stable~\cite{samoradnitsky94}.}.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0cm,itemindent=.5cm,labelwidth=\itemindent,labelsep=0cm,align=left]
\item All patches are independent. 
Just as the classical locally stationary
model~\cite{liutkus11t} assumes independence of overlapping frames,
we assume here independence of overlapping patches. Due to the
overlap between them, this assumption is an approximation,
and one may wonder what the advantage is of dropping independent frames
for independent patches. 
The answer lies in the fact that the latter permits us to model phase dependencies between neighboring STFT entries, and also to model much longer-term dependencies, as required for instance by deterministic damped or frequency-modulated sinusoidal signals.\label{enu:assumption_independent_patches}
\item Each patch is \emph{stationary}: its distribution
is assumed invariant under translations in the TF plane. This is where we do not assume independence, but on the contrary expect dependencies among neighboring STFT entries. Our approach assumes this happens in a way that only depends on the relative positions in
the TF plane. It can easily be shown that mixtures of
damped sinusoids have this property. Assuming stationarity not only over time but over both time and frequency
also permits us to naturally account for mixtures of frequency-modulated
sounds. In short, we assume that throughout each patch, we observe
one coherent STFT ``texture''. The difference with the HR-NMF model is that we have independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) innovations for one given patch, whereas HR-NMF model has more variability. 
However, taking overlapping patches somehow compensates for
this limitation.\label{enu:assumption_stationary}
% \item The joint distribution of all entries of each patch is $\alpha$-stable~\cite{samoradnitsky94}.
% $\alpha$-stable distributions are the only ones that are stable under additions, \emph{i.e.} such that
% sums of $\alpha$-stable random variables (r.v.) remain $\alpha$-stable.
% They notably comprise the Gaussian and Cauchy distributions as special
% cases when $\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=1$, respectively.\label{enu:assumption_alpha_stable}
\item Each patch is harmonisable, \emph{i.e.} is the inverse Fourier
transform of a complex random measure with independent increments.
In other words, all entries of the Fourier transform of each patch
are assumed to be asymptotically independent, as the size of the patch
gets larger. This rather technical condition, often tacitly made in
signal processing studies, permits efficient processing in the frequency
domain.\label{enu:assumption_harmonisable}
\end{enumerate}

Under those assumptions, all entries of the CFT are independent
(assumptions~\ref{enu:assumption_independent_patches} and~\ref{enu:assumption_stationary})\footnote{This result is the direct generalization
of~\cite[th. 6.5.1]{samoradnitsky94} to multi-dimensional stationary processes.}) 
where $P\left(a,b,f,t\right)$ is a nonnegative Tensor with dimensions $N_{a}\times N_{b}\times N_{f}\times N_{t}$
 that we call the \emph{modulation density}. In
the general case, it can basically be understood as the energy found at $\left(a,b\right)$ for patch
$\left(f,t\right)$, just like more classical power spectral
densities describe the spectro-temporal energy content of the STFT
of a locally stationary signal.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the CFT as Filterbank}
\label{sub:interpretation}

An alternative interpretation of the CFT can be obtained by regarding the 2D-DFT
as two subsequent 1D-DFTs. If the transform in frequency direction (DFT-F) is
applied first, it is equivalent to a partial inverse DFT plus time reversal. If
the time reversal would be undone and an overlap-add would be applied, the
output would correspond to a subband representation with a frequency resolution
of $N_\omega / N_a$. Each of the $N_a$ final transformations (DFT-T) in one
patch takes output values from $N_b$ DFT-Ts with equal indices. This corresponds
to a splitting into poly-phase components with downsampling factor $N_a$ of the
time signal obtained by placing the output frames from the DFT-Ts in a row.
Thus, the outputs of the DFT-Fs have a very high frequency resolution of
$N_\omega N_b$ but contain aliasing components from the downsampling.
\par
This interpretation of the CFT gives some indications for its benefits in the
separation of modulated sources. Due to the poly-phase representation it has a
relatively high temporal resolution. The periodicities in the spectra caused
by downsampling make the CFT relatively independent of frequency shifts, so
that, for example, the output patch of a single sinusoidal sweep is mainly
influenced by the sweep rate.
% TODO: show sweeps?
% TODO: add complexity analaysis and plot maybe?


\subsection{Signal Separation}
Now, let us assume that the observed waveform is actually the sum
of~$K$ underlying components~$\{ \tilde{s}_{k}\} _{k=1,\dots,K}$.
Due to the linearity of the CFT, this can be
expressed in the CFT domain as:
$$
\forall\left(a,b,f,t\right),x\left(a,b,f,t\right)=\sum\nolimits_{k}s_{k}\left(a,b,f,t\right).
$$
If we adopt the model presented above for each source
and use the stability property, we have:
$$
\mV\left(a,b,f,t\right)\sim \sum\nolimits_{k}P_{k}\left(a,b,f,t\right),
$$
where $P_{k}$ is the modulation density for component~$k$.
% If these objects are known, it can be shown that each source can be
% estimated in a maximum a posteriori sense from the mixture as:
% \begin{equation}
% \mathbb{E}\left[s_{j}\left(a,b,f,t\right)\mid \{ P_{j}\} _{j},x\right]=\tfrac{P_{j}\left(a,b,f,t\right)}{\sum_{j'}P_{j'}\left(a,b,f,t\right)} \, x\left(a,b,f,t\right)\label{eq:alpha_wiener}
% \end{equation}
% which we call the Wiener filter in~\cite{liutkus15}.
The resulting waveforms are readily obtained by inverting the CFT.\@
As can be seen, we now need to estimate the modulation
densities~$\{ P_{k}\}_{k}$ based on the observation
of the mixture CFT~$x$, similarly to the estimation of
 the sources' Power Spectral Densities (PSD)
in source separation studies.

\subsubsection{Factorization Model and Parameter Estimation}
\label{sub:NTF}

In order to estimate the sources' modulation densities, we first impose
a factorization model over them, so as to reduce the number of parameters
to be estimated. In this study, we set:

\begin{equation}
\mP_{abft} \approx \sum_{k=1}^{K}a_{abfk}h_{tk},\label{eq:NTF_model}
\end{equation}
for  $a = 1 , \ldots , N_a, b = 1 , \ldots , N_b, f = 1 , \ldots , N_f , t = 1 , \ldots , N_t , k = 1 , \ldots , K$
nonnegative tensors, respectively. We call this a \emph{Common Fate
Model}. Intuitively, $\mA$ is a modulation density template that
is different for each frequency band~$f$, and that captures the
long term modulation profile of each source around that frequency.
Then, $\vh$ is an activation vector that indicates the strength
of source on the patches located at temporal position~$t$.
The factorization model is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:cfm}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.66\columnwidth]{Chapters/06_Separation_Unknown/figures/cfm.pdf}
\caption{Visualization of the Common Fate Model factorization model.}
\label{fig:cfm}
\end{figure}

% TODO: we also experiment with a, b * f * t with worse results. This means that the modulation tensor is not frequency independent.

% TODO: All patches are independent? Wie passt das zusammen?

Learning those parameters can be achieved using the conventional Nonnegative
Tensor Factorization methodology (see e.g.~\cite{cichoki09,ozerov12,smaragdis14}
for an overview), except that it is applied to the CFT instead of the STFT,
and that the particular factorization to be used is~\eqref{eq:NTF_model}.

In essence, it amounts to estimating the parameters~$\{ A_{k},H_{k}\} $
so that the modulus of the CFT is
as close as possible to~$\sum_{k}P_{k}$, with some particular
cost function as a data-fit criterion, called a $\beta$-divergence
and which includes Euclidean, Kullback-Leibler and Itakura-Saito as
special cases~\cite{fitzgerald08a}. As usual in non-negative models,
each parameter is updated in turn, while the others are kept fixed.
We provide the multiplicative updates in Algorithm~\ref{alg:Fitting-NTF}.
After a few iterations, the parameters can be used to separate the sources using the Wiener filter as described in~\cite{liutkus15}.

In this section, we present separation experiments utilizing CFM and compare it with other methods.

\subsubsection{Synthetic Example}
\label{sub:Synthentic_Examples}

To illustrate the CFT representation we processed a mixture consisting of two sinusoidal sources. One source is a pure sine wave of fundamental frequency 440~Hz whereas the other is frequency modulated by a sinusoid of 6.3~Hz. In the first step an STFT with a DFT-length of 1024 samples and a hop-size of 256 samples was processed at a sample rate of 22.05~kHz. Patches of size $(N_a, N_b) = (32, 48)$ (not respecting overlaps) were then taken from the STFT output. Figure~\ref{fig:CFT} in Section~\ref{sub:CFT} then shows the Common Fate Transform for the mixture as described in Section~\ref{sec:model}. One can see that the CFT representation shows distinct patterns across time, suggesting that the factorization is able to separate the sources. 
Furthermore, if we now looking at a smaller excerpt of the same synthetic example, depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:gridplot}, we can also observe the additivity property of the common fate representations.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Objective Evaluation on Unison Instrument Mixtures}

To evaluate the proposed method, five musical instrument samples were selected from the Unison Separation Dataset~\cite{oss_unison} --- all of them feature vibrato: violin, cello, tenor sax, English horn, and flute. It is important to note that vibrato techniques differ between these instruments: whereas the English horn and the flute only produce a very subtle modulation, the violin and tenor sax have powerful frequency modulations with a higher modulation frequency as well as a higher modulation index. 
All samples last about three seconds. 
We then generated a combination of ten mixtures of two instruments each, each one generated with a simple SourceA --- SourceB --- (SourceA + SourceB) scheme. Data were encoded in 44.1 kHz / 16 bit.
We compared separation performance of six different methods, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:methods}:
\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]
\item[CFM] For the CFM model, we took an STFT with frames of 1024 samples and a hop-size of 512 samples. The resulting complex STFT was then split into a grid of patches of size $(N_a, N_b) = (4, 64)$, each having a half-window overlap in both dimensions.
\item[MOD] We implemented a modified version of~\cite{barker13} where for the sake of comparability, we used a STFT instead of a gammatone filterbank. A DFT length of 1024 and a hop-size of 512 samples were chosen. After taking the magnitude value, a second STFT of size 32 and hop-size 16 samples was computed for each frequency.
\item[CFMMOD] We selected patch sizes of $(N_a, N_b) = (1, 64)$ and modified the representation so that the magnitude was applied before computing the 2D-DFT.\@ This permits to compare the advantage of our proposed factorization model~(\ref{eq:NTF_model}) over MOD, when using the same kind of energy-modulation representation in both cases.
\item[CFMM] For comparing the influence of computing modulations over complex STFT or magnitude STFT, we tried our factorization model when the magnitude of the STFT is taken before 2D-DFT, with patches of the same size as for the CFM method.
\item[NMF] We took a standard NMF based method~\cite{virtanen07}. We highlight that taking a STFT with frames of length 1024 would not make a fair comparison, because the CFM model actually results in a larger frequency resolution. Therefore a comparable NMF is based on an STFT of DFT-length 32768.
\item[HR-NMF] See description in~\cite{magron15a}.
\end{description}
All factorizations ran for 100 iterations and were repeated five times. We chose $k=(2\ldots6)$ components for each factorization. For $k > 2$ we used oracle clustering to show the upper limit of SDR which can be achieved.

We ran the performance evaluation by using BSSeval~\cite{vincent06}. The results of Signal to Distortion
Ratio (SDR), Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR), and Signal to Artifacts Ration (SAR) are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot_overall}. 
Results indicate that the CFM model performs well in all measures. 
However, in terms of SIR, the results of HR-NMF are better than CFM method. The results for CFMMOD and CFMM indicate the positive influence of the CFM factorization compared to~\cite{barker13}.
The results of CFMM indicate that the complex CFT lead to better results. NMF did perform surprisingly well, which may only hold for our test set, where each source is active for a long period. This results in a cyclic stationary vibrato, revealing spectral side lobes at such a high resolution. With more than one component per source, the results of CFM do improve, but it can be seen that more than two components ($k=4$) will not increase the SDR values. The separation results and a full Python implementation of the CFM algorithm can be found on the companion website~\footnote{\url{github.com/aliutkus/commonfate}}.

\section{Common Fate Model for Lead Accompaniment Separation using Deep Neural Network}

\marginpar{This section is original work being done as part of the \emph{STO1} and \emph{STO2} submission for the SiSEC 2016~\cite{sisec16}. Part of the literature overview is take from~\cite{rafii}.}

In the previous section, we showed, that the common fate model is suitable to separate highly overlapped signals based on their spatial-temporal modulation texture.
In this section I want to show how this method can be extended for the application of lead and accompaniment separation.
This scenario is significantly more complex than the separation of single instrument notes, hence the separation model needs to be flexible enough to handle many of the critical edge cases which make music separation challenging.
With recent success of machine learning models, it, however, became apparent that an unsupervised model such as NTF or CFM may not be flexible enough to enforce the significant amount of domain knowledge that is present in this scenario to improve performance.
% from zafar
Taking advantage of the recent availability of sufficiently large databases of isolated vocals along with their accompaniment, several researchers investigated the use of machine learning methods to directly estimate a mapping between the mixture and the sources.
However, most other systems today, still use classical time-frequency representations, building time-frequency masks.
% end zafar
\par
The common structure of a deep learning methods for lead and accompaniment separation usually corresponds to the one depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:methods_dnn}.
Most methods mainly differ in the architecture picked for the network, its input and output representation as well as in the way the network is trained.

% from zafar
Providing a thorough introduction to deep neural networks (DNN) is out of the scope of this thesis.
For the understanding of this section, it is sufficient to mention that DNNs consist of a cascade of several, possibly non-linear transformations of the input, which are learned during a training stage.
They were shown to effectively learn representations and mappings, provided enough data is available for estimating their parameters \cite{deng14, lecun15, goodfellow16}.
Different architectures for neural networks may be combined/cascaded together, and many architectures were proposed in the past, such as feedforward fully-connected neural networks (FNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), or RNN and variants such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) and the gated-recurrent units (GRU).
Training of such functions is achieved by stochastic gradient descent \cite{robbins51} and associated algorithms, such as backpropagation~\cite{rumelhart862} or backpropagation through time~\cite{rumelhart86} (BTT) for the case of RNNs.
\par
%The first one: Huang
% zafar
Huang et al. were the first to propose deep neural networks, RNNs here \cite{hermans13,pascanu14}, for singing voice separation in \cite{huang14,huang15}. They adapted their framework from \cite{huang142} to model all sources simultaneously through masking. Input and target functions were the mixture magnitude and a joint representation of the individual sources. The objective was to estimate jointly either singing voice and accompaniment music, or speech and background noise from the corresponding mixtures.
\par
%Exploiting context: FNN with context, LSTM
Modeling the temporal structures of both the lead and the accompaniment is a considerable challenge, even when using DNN methods. As an alternative to the RNN approach proposed by Huang et al. in \cite{huang14}, Uhlich et al. proposed the usage of the simpler FNNs \cite{uhlich15} whose input consists of \textit{supervectors} of a few consecutive frames from the mixture.
\par
I decided to deploy model of Uhlich~\cite{uhlich15} to evaluate the separation quality.
The aim of this work was to exactly reproduce the results of~\cite{uhlich15}, but instead, to evaluate one main research questions: does a DNN based model benefit from the common fate representation being able to better capture the modulation texture?
For the implementation of the model, I using the Keras~\cite{chollet15} deep learning framework to systematically assess the input-and output representation of the system.

\par
The network, as proposed in~\cite{uhlich15} is a three layer fully connected network, where each of the hidden layer has the same number of hidden nodes as the targeted output representation.
This method can be described as a variant of a stacked denoising autoencoder~\cite{pvincent08}, where the noisy input is mapped to a clean output of the same dimensionality.
The architecture is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:cft_dnn}. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Chapters/06_Separation_Unknown/figures/uhlich_dnn.pdf}
\caption{}
\label{fig:cft_dnn}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

The purpose of the FNN then is to create a non-linear mapping function from the magnitude of the input mixture \(\mX\) to the magnitude of the target source \(\mY_j\).
The optimal parameters (weights) \(\theta_j\) of such a mapping function \(\mY_j = f_{\theta_j}(\mX)\) are learned via supervised training.
FNN networks, such as the one used here, can only deal with temporal structure by reshaping the time-frequency input to a super vector to be processed by the FNN.
This makes it difficult to learn structure of neighboring time frequency bins. 
However this drawback is compensated by the large number of parameters in an FNN layer.

Since the STFT, GFT and CFT are lapped transforms different scenarios for the input and output representation of the FNN can be envisioned:

\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]
\item[STFT-STFT]: for the \emph{input}, I computed the STFT (\(N=1024, Hop=512\) of each the audio track and select excerpts of size, \(\mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{R}^{2C + 1}_{+} \), where \(C\) is the number of preceding and succeeding frames around the central frame \(\mathbf{X}_{i+C}\). For the \emph{output}, only a single central frame \(\mathbf{Y}_{i+C}\) is selected.
I use \(C=2\), reflecting the setting in~\cite{uhlich15}. This results in an input sample size of \(\mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{R}_{+}^{5, 513}\) and  \(\mathbf{Y} \in \mathcal{R}_{+}^{1, 513}\).

\item[GFT-GFT/GFT-STFT]: instead of taking excerpts from the STFT, like in \emph{STFT-STFT}, I compute overlapping patches, as described from in Section~\ref{sub:CFT}. Each patch is of size \((5, 8)\), which means that the same number of time frames are used compared to \emph{STFT-STFT} but additionaly redundancy has been added because of the overlap between neighbouring patches.
For the \emph{output}, I chose the GFT of \(Y\).
This results in an input sample size of \(\mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{R}_{+}^{128, 5, 8}\) and  \(\mathbf{Y} \in \mathcal{R}_{+}^{128, 5, 8)}\).
Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters, I also evaluated a setting where just the \emph{output} is the central frame of the STFT.

\item[CFT-CFT/CFT-STFT]: here, in the first step a processing as in \emph{GFT-GFT} was applied and then the 2D-DFT transform was applied (see Section~\ref{sub:CFT}).
The results in an identical shapes as in the \emph{GFT-GFT} but with added benefits of this representation can model neighbouring phase dependencies.
\end{description}

I used the DSD100 dataset~\cite{ono15} for training and test. 
For each sample fed into the network, I randomly selected mixture tracks from the DSD100 dataset.

\subsection{Training}

I then sample from the DSD100 tracks and form single sample as input for the FNN.
Therefore I first compute the input representation of an audio track from the DSD100 set and then create samples by randomly sampling without replacement from these tracks.
The actual training has been done using mini-batches of size 32.
Each architecture is trained using the ADAM optimizer~\cite{kingma14} (learning rate: \(1 \cdot 10^{-3}\), \(\beta_1=0.9\), \(\beta_2=0.999\), \(\epsilon=1 \cdot 10^{-8}\))
The model was trained for a fixed number of 30 epochs and, in contrast to~\cite{uhlich15}, greedy layerwise pre-training was not applied.

\subsection{Results}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Chapters/06_Separation_Unknown/figures/boxplot.pdf}
\caption{BSSEval separation results of the DSD100 dataset results for vocals and accompaniment sources. Several combinations of `input-output` were tested, as indicated by the x-axis.}
\label{fig:deep_cft_boxplots}
\end{figure}

For evaluation, the BSSEval metrics of all representations for the DSD100 test set were computed.
The results are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:deep_cft_boxplots}.
They indicate that the common fate representation is indeed improving the baseline \emph{STFT-STFT} results.
Overall, we can report a mean difference of 0.4~dB for CFT-CFT and 0.5dB for GFT-GFT, compared the \emph{STFT-STFT} representation.
However, it is worth mentioning that both, the GFT and the CFT representation lead to a significant increase in redundancy in the representation resulting in an increased number of trainable parameters per network layer (26219520 for CFT vs 263682 for STFT).

% Maybe want to rewrite as it has been stolen from zafar
The first observation one can see in Figure~\ref{fig:eval} the difference in performance between data-driven methods and ``classical'' unsupervised methods. 
Further it shows that exploiting learning data does help separation greatly compared to only relying on \textit{a priori} assumptions such as the harmonicity or redundancy. Additionally, dynamic models such as LSTM from UHL2-3 appear more adapted to music than FNN. 
These good performances in audio source separation go in line with the recent success of DNNs in fields as varied as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing \cite{lecun15}.
\par
Relating our results of STO1 and STO2 to the other methods, we observe that our results performed only slightly below the state-of-the-art performance of UHL and NUG.
Furthermore, the difference between test and validation dataset indicate, that our CFT DNN model even has better generalization as the one in NUG. 
While our STO model share the same network architecture as UHL1, we were unable to reproduce the results, as we are approximately 1~dB below UHL1.
One reason is in the difference in initialization of the model as well as the fact that NUG and UHL models exploit multichannel information. 
%IBM much better: room for improvement
\par
In SiSEC 2016, the separation performance achieved by a totally informed filtering method such as IBM, is significantly higher than that of any submitted method in this evaluation. 
This means that lead and accompaniment separation has room for much improvement, and that the topic is bound to witness many breakthroughs still. 
This is even more true considering that IBM is not the best upper bound for separation performance: other filtering methods such as \textit{ideal ratio mask}~\cite{liutkus15c} or multichannel Wiener filter~\cite{duong10} may be considered as references.
\par
For more details and the ability for playback of the estimates, I refer to the dedicated interactive website that I built as part of my organizational help for SiSEC\footnote{\url{http://www.sisec17.audiolabs-erlangen.de}}.
In fact, for the first time, interested researchers are now able to listen to over 10000 stimuli from all participating systems.
This was made possible through modern JavaScript technologies like the Web Audio API to interactively assess source separation results in the browser.
For each track, separation results are provided as well as the objective BSSeval scores, all of the data is reproducible and was made available in~\cite{oss_sisecwebsite}.
Figure~\ref{fig:sisec_website} depicts a screenshot of the website.
The objective scores are depicted as an interactive matrix where users are able to sort the results for each track an each system interactively by the the source of interest.
Clicking on one rectangles in the heatmap opens the interactive player that allows to simultaneously playback the separated sources including changing the volume of each source.

\section{Chapter Summary and Discussion}

% [X] A summary of findings and limitations
% [ ] Practical applications/implications
% [X] Recommendations for further research
In this chapter, I presented methods that exploit modulations for source separation using unsupervised methods. 
In the first part of this chapter, I presented a study where we demonstrated the use of the modulation spectrogram tensors for separating unison instrument mixtures, comparing the results with those presented in the previous chapter.
In a next step we proposed complex tensor representation, the Common Fate Transform (CFT), computed from rectangular patches of the complex STFT using a two-dimensional DFTs.
This novel representation exposes joint modulation characteristics of amplitude and frequency modulated signals while being fully invertible.
We demonstrated the usefulness of this representation using our Common Fate Model that factorizes patches from the CFT into two components, a modulation pattern and it is activation. 
The model is inspired by the humans' ability to group common modulations into a single sources.
We presented results on unison musical instruments that indicate that it outperforms existing methods.
\par
At the time, our research was conducted, NMF and NTF models were clearly considered to be the best choice when it comes to state-of-the-art separation models. 
However, for the scenario of music separation, it turned out that the CFM model was still requiring a significant amount of additional hand crafted engineering.
This, changed over the course of 2015/2016 when other researchers successfully proved the superiority of supervised learning based methods for separation (See SiSEC 2015~\cite{ono15}).
In the second part of this chapter, to further study the effectiveness the Common Fate representation, I replaced the Common Fate model and instead combined it with an existing deep learning based separation model~\cite{uhlich15}.
I showed that the CFT indeed improved separation quality compared to  STFT in fully connected deep neural network.
Last, but not least, I presented interactive evaluation tools, developed for SiSEC, that allows to interactively assess the performance of separation systems both, objectively and subjectively.
\par
The research, that has been carried out marks an important step in multidimensional representations that more closely model the human perception when it comes to highly overlapped, modulated mixtures.
Work by other researchers built upon our first findings, even further increased the perceptual aspect of the representation by introducing a multi-resolution version of the CFT~\cite{seetharaman17, pishdadian17}.
\par
Even though the CFT significantly increases the input size (due to its redundancy) and the number of trainable network parameters (due to its stacked auto-encoder architecture), generalization performance did not suffer.
The results were submitted to the 2016 SiSEC Evaluation campaign~\cite{sisec16} and ranked in the upper third of all 23 submitted systems.
One limitation of the CFT is its increased redundancy, introduced by its aliasing components,  which increases the complexity of the training.
Interestingly, preliminary studies suggested that a removal of the (redundant) components did not improve the performance.
It remains to be studied how this aspect of the CFT can be improved.
\par
A promising route for future work would be to replace the fully connected model based on~\cite{uhlich15} with a model that specifically is designed to deal with higher dimensional data such as the 4D CFT. Capsule network, or multidimensional convolutional networks.
