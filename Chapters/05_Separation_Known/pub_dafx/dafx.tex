\label{sub:frequency_modulation}

% Vibrato rate around 5 Hertz. Similar to the tremor in parkinson deseases~\cite{fletcher01}.

Frequency modulation caused by vibrato is a very common playing style for string instruments but also for woodwind and brass instruments. Vibrato is an effect that is well studied especially in musicology. Performers tend to perform a vibrato in the same way when repeating a performance. This can be exploited in source separation scenarios. Typically, vibratos have modulation frequencies (rates) which vary between 4 and 8 Hz. Additionally vibrato rates vary across different instruments. In \cite{macleod06} the vibrato width (frequency deviation) was found to be significantly different between violinists and violists performers.


As with the amplitude modulated case NMF lacks the ability to model time varying frequencies since the $\mathbf{W}$ matrix is stationary. Several extensions for NMF have been proposed to improve the decomposition quality. \cite{hennequin11} proposes frequency dependent activations matrices, \cite{smaragdis08} has developed a system which can be described as shift invariant NMF. Another approach is to model the spectral pattern changes by Markov chains \cite{nakano10}. All these approaches attempt to model the non-stationary effects within the decomposition model. In this paper we propose a method that increases the stationarity of the signal in preprocessing step and then use the standard NMF for the decomposition. \\

We make use of \emph{time-warping} which refers to a mapping of the linear
time scale $t$ to a warped time scale $\tau$ via a mapping function
$\tau=w(t)$. To ensure a unique mapping, the mapping function needs to be strictly increasing. For the discrete time case the mapping can be achieved by a time-varying re-sampling of the linear (i.e. regularly sampled) time signal under consideration.
The instantaneous sampling frequency then corresponds to the first derivative of
the mapping function. Although the mapping can be done from any time-span
$I$ on the linear time scale to any time span $J$ on the warped time scale, in
the discrete time case it is advantageous to have the same number of samples
in the linear and warped time domain. This ensures that the average sampling
frequency is the same in both domains. Such time-warping approaches have already
been proposed for different purposes such as transform-based audio coding
\cite{edler09}. As in these applications, we derive the mapping function from
the varying instantaneous fundamental frequency in such a manner that the variation of the frequency is
reduced or removed. To be more precise the actual information needed is not
the absolute instantaneous fundamental frequency but only its change over time.
The discrete time warp map $w[n]$ is then simply the scaled sum of the relative
frequencies $f[n]$:
\begin{equation}
w[n]=N \frac{\sum^n_{l=0}{f[l]}}{\sum^N_{k=0}{f[k]}}  \qquad 0\leq n<N,
\end{equation}
where $N$ being the number of samples of the signal under consideration.
From the requirements for the mapping function it follows that the relative
frequency $f[n]$ has to be positive at all instants and preferably should not
exhibit large jumps.
For the mapping from linear to warped time now the linear domain sample points
$s[\nu]$ for the regularly spaced samples $x[\nu]$ in the warped domain are
found by inverting $w[n]$. These sample points are then used to re-sample the linear time
domain samples $x[n]$ to the warped time domain samples $x[\nu]$, in our case
by employing an 128 times oversampled FIR low-pass filter. This processing leads to a sampling rate contour which is proportional to the pitch contour. Or in other words, a fixed number of samples are obtained in each period of the signal with the varying fundamental frequency. Mutatis mutandis the sample points $s[\nu]$ can be used for the re-sampling from warped time domain to linear time
domain. \\

In this paper the time-warping was done globally over the full lengths of the
signals under consideration. The globally time-warped sample sequence
was then used in the further processing steps. In Figure~\ref{fig:timewarptime} we show the results of the warping process in the time domain. \\

A similar approach using frequency modulation to separate a harmonic
source from a mixture was proposed in \cite{wang95}. Here the
individual lines are demodulated to the base band using a combined frequency
tracking/demodulation approach. The difference to our approach is that first
the absolute instantaneous frequency for every harmonic line has to be known
instead of a relative frequency that is common to all harmonic lines of a single
source. This relative frequency might be obtained easier than its
absolute value for a mixed signal. Secondly every harmonic line has to be individually
frequency demodulated while in our approach the full signal is frequency demodulated in one algorithmic step.\\

To build a test set we selected 10 instrumental items noted in Table~\ref{tab:testset}. The items have each been generated by rendering C4 notes in a state of the art software sampler. All test have a duration of about three seconds. Items were equalized in loudness by using an iterative calculation of the loudness algorithm of the time varying Zwicker model. The implementation \cite{genesis12} was used. The 10 instrument items then generated 45 unique mixtures of two instruments each. The processing was done in 44.1~kHz / 16 bit.

\section{Pitch Variation Informed Source Separation} % (fold)
\label{ssub:pitch_variation_informed_source_separation}

With the ability to remove the frequency modulation from a signal we can then include this system in a source separation system to address the non-stationarity issues of NMF based approaches. Figure~\ref{fig:warpingdemo} shows how this system works on a harmonic FM signal mixture. Plots (a) and (b) show the two input signals which are linearly mixed (c). For each source the warp contour needs to be calculated. The mixture is then warped with pitch variation estimates of source 1  (d) and source 2 (e). The actual separation/filtering of the sources is then done by using NMF which is not shown here. To separate the components from the warped mixture we used NMF on a spectrogram computed with a very long DFT (about 0.5 s). NMF can work unsupervised by detecting the more tonal $\textbf{W}$ component by using a spectral flatness measure. The separated signals (f) and (g) then need to be warped back into the original time domain resulting in (h) and (i).

It is important to clarify that this approach would not be
able to separate two modulating instruments playing in unison without having
prior knowledge about the individual modulation functions. Although a pitch variation estimate might be difficult to achieve in a mixture our approach shows that such a system can make sense.

We wanted to evaluate the methods proposed in Sections~\ref{sub:am} and \ref{sub:frequency_modulation} so that they show the fundamental differences in their separation quality. Like in \cite{barker13} we choose not to address the problem of clustering the components after the matrix factorization operation. Instead of processing mixtures in a $A-B-AB$ or $A-AB-B$ paradigm we went for a supervised learning phase where we had access to the original source individually. In this \emph{oracle} supervised approach for each of the sources we then learned the spectral, temporal (for NMF), and modulation gain components (for MOD-NTF) and concatenated them. The learned coefficients were then used to initialize the final factorization process. This way we can achieve the maximum possible quality.

% \subsection{Algorithms} % (fold)
% \label{sub:algorithms}

% from dafx
The test set was processed by three algorithms: standard NMF, pitch variation informed NMF (PVI-NMF) (Section~\ref{ssub:pitch_variation_informed_source_separation}) and the non-negative tensor factorization based on modulation spectra (MOD-NTF) as described in Section~\ref{sub:am}). All factorizations for NMF and NTF were computed by minimizing the $\beta = 1$ divergence (Kullback-Leibler divergence). The Pitch Variation Informed-NMF (PVI-NMF) has been set up in the same way as the other algorithms. We choose to calculate results with $K=2$ and $K=4$. The pitch variation estimator is based on a method that was proposed by B\"ackstr\"om in 2009 \cite{backstrom09} with a subsequent post-processing to ensure the smoothness of the mapping. \\

Each of the algorithms did perform on the same filter bank and with the same sample rate. NMF approach did use a 2048 STFT with 512 samples hop size. For the MOD-NTF a second STFT based filter bank was used with 256 sample DFT size and 64 sample hop size. All methods use soft masking / wiener filtering for the actual synthesis.

\subsection{Evaluation}
% \label{sec:results}

The results were evaluated by using commonly used evaluation measures provided by the PEASS Toolbox \cite{emiya11}. The evaluation measure are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Overall Perceptual Score (OPS)
  \item Target-related Perceptual Score (TPS)
  \item Interference-related Perceptual Score (IPS)
  \item Artifacts-related Perceptual Score (APS)
  \item Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDRi)
  \item Source to Interference Ratio (SIRi)
  \item Sources to Artifacts Ratio (SARi) \footnote{The $i$ indicates that these scores have been calculated by decomposition with PEASS \cite{emiya11} instead of \textsc{BSS Eval}.}
\end{itemize}

The mean values of the PEASS evaluation are provided in Table~\ref{tab:results}. It can be seen that the SDR values give a different tendency than the OPS score, showing that the differences between both measures are substantial. Since unison mixtures are even very challening for humans to segregate we chose to focus on the psycho-acoustically weighted performance measures only. The results show a slightly better overall performance for the PVI-NMF. A more fine grained overview from the OPS results experiment is presented in Figure~\ref{tab:resultsmatrix}. It can be seen that results vary a lot between the mixtures. The modulation tensor factorization (MOD-NTF) performs good on mixtures like Clarinet-Viola (71-41) or Clarinet-Cello (71-42)  where one source has vibrato and the other does not (see plots (e,f)). Although it performs well on average, MOD-NTF shows a high variance in the OPS results. The results have also been evaluated and confirmed subjectively by informal listening. Additionally we provide selected stimuli online on an acompanying webpage \footnote{\url{http://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/2014-DAFx-Unison/}}. In general the PEASS scores give a good indication of quality. However the artifacts that are introduced by the standard NMF synthesis seem to be not well reflected. One possible reason is that PEASS toolbox has not been tested on artifacts from unison mixtures. \\
Future work could include a robust multi pitch variation estimator for musical instruments. Salamon and Gomez \cite{salamon12} describe the current state of the art of f0 estimation. Some approaches use source separation to estimate multiple f0 pitch tracks. Therefore our approach shows that a robust multi pitch f0 estimate can also help to improve source separation. In the future an iterative multi-step procedure could lead to better results in both problem domains.

This paper proposes a new source separation scenario for instruments played in unison. It highlights the time-varying aspects of the signal sources like amplitude or frequency modulations. By addressing these aspects, the separation quality for non-unison mixtures can generally be improved, too.
Furthermore we present two methods to decompose those mixtures based on differences in the amplitude or frequency modulation of the sources. One is using a method already published based on a modulation tensor factorization. The other is a novel method that uses an estimate of the pitch variation of the two input sources to warp the mixture. Within the warped domain the frequency modulation of the desired source is removed so that the sources can be separated more easily from the mixture. The results of 45 mixtures have been evaluated by using the PEASS toolbox. The scores indicate an improvement of about 2 OPS points in favor of the pitch variation informed NMF compared to the standard NMF.
