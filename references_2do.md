> The excerpts’ short length could create further problems, as stream segregation appears to be cumulative (see Bregman, 1978):
listeners tend to hear one stream at first before subsequently resolving more. In all, because our stimuli are both short and isotextural, counting would not be expected to be a successful strategy in the present denumeration task.
