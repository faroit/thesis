	Abstract = {Summary
Frequency and amplitude modulations and their phase relationships in vocal vibrato were investigated in an effort to integrate the current body of sometimes contradictory and confusing observations regarding this vocal phenomenon. A resonance-harmonics interaction alone was found to explain sufficiently the various phase relationships between F0 and amplitude modulations as well as the extent of amplitude modulations for most of the present data and many of the observations reported in the literature. Implications were discussed for physiological, aerodynamic, and perceptual investigations of vocal vibrato as well as for investigations comparing pathologic vocal tremor with vocal vibrato.},
