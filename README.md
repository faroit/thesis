## Create PDF

### Requirements

TexLive 2019

### Build Document

Run `make`.

### Create diff using git-latex diff

due to bugs in the git-latex diff's flatten, we need to manually create a flattened latex file:

```bash
python latex-flatten.py ClassicThesis.tex thesis_original.tex
git checkout XXXXXX
python latex-flatten.py ClassicThesis.tex thesis_revisionXXXXXX.tex
latexdiff thesis_original.tex thesis_revisionXXXXXX.tex > diff.tex
make diff.pdf
```
