### Modulation Spectrogram/Representations

~\cite{greenberg96}
Modulations spectrogram for speech are usually calibrated to 4 Hz modulation rate also from 

Feature design ~\cite{lagrange10} for discriminative speech features

joint AM/FM method for CASA for\cite{abe98}

> Zwicker (324) showed that the threshold for detecting AM is very small at low modulation frequencies

Modulation based filterbanks are used for different purposes than vibrato. \cite{barker13} was tuned to medium rate modulations of speech

as seen in ~\cite{barker13}
1. filterbank
2. generate modulation for each filterbank channel (HWR?)
3. spectrum

~\cite{greenberg96}

> The modulation spectrum for an octave-wide channel, arithmetically centered at 1.5 kHz, computed from a single speaker's discourse over a two-minute interval is shown and compared with that of the distribution of syllable durations (transformed into equivalent modulation frequencies). The similarity between the two measurements suggests that much of the energy in the modulation spectrum may be derived from syllabic segmentation. This association is of interest in light of recent demonstrations that speech intelligibility is crucially dependent on the preservation of the portion of the modulation spectrum between 2 and 10 Hz.

> \cite{sturm12} Modulation representations of acoustic signals describe the variation of spectral power in scale, rate, time and frequency. This approach has been motivated by the human auditory and visual systems.
