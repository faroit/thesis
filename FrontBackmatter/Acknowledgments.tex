\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\begin{small}
First of all, I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr.-Ing. Bernd Edler for all his help and support throughout all the years. Bernd is the nicest and kindest supervisor anyone could have: his door was always open for me to have fruitful discussions and solve tricky problems together and at the same time he was giving me enough freedom to allow me to develop my own research ideas.

\bigskip

Besides my advisor, I want to thank Prof. Gaël Richard for taking the time to review my thesis.
I also want to thank Dr. Antoine Liutkus for inviting me to Nancy for a summer research visit that resulted in so many good ideas and a great friendship!
